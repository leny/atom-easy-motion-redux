**Note:** this package is a partial rewrite of the great [easy-motion package](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion) from Adrian Budau.

The original package seems dead and, with the deprecation of the atom API pre-1.0, it's sad that we can't use easy-motion in atom anymore. So, i rewrite the package, waiting for news from Adrian.

Check out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.

To start easy-motion press **Shift+Cmd+E**. Rebind this in settings to better suit you. By default the characters that replace words are **ABC....Z**. You can replace this if you want, also from settings.

**Note:** the package is like *in beta*, since the original code used many features that has been deprecated with the atom API v1.0. Don't hesitate to report issues & bugs, or submit pull requests to help me maintain this package.
